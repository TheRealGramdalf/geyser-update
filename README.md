# GeyserMC/Floodgate Updater

 An update script for GeyserMC/floodgate, built for pterodactyl.

 # Usage

 Currently there isn't enough that I feel it needs documentation, so everything you need should be within the code itself (with comments along the way to help)
 Docs may be added in the future if this evolves.

 # But I don't use Pterodactyl...

 That's fine! Just set the `$volpath` to the path that contains your server folder- *not* the folder with your `server.jar` and `server.properties` etc. etc. 
 Then set the `$server_uuid` to the name of the folder containing your server files, and it should work as expected.
